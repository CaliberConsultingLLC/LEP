        You are an expert leadership coach and organizational psychologist. Your task is to generate a personalized leadership continuous improvement campaign for the leader based on the following leadership analysis:

        ${analysis}

        First, select 5 core leadership traits that the leader should focus on improving.

        For each selected trait, create 3 team-facing survey statements. Each statement should describe a clear, observable behavior associated with that trait â€” something the team would be able to observe and rate.

        These statements will be rated by the team using a dual-axis 9-box grid (one axis for how well the leader demonstrates the behavior, one for how much the leader focuses on improving it).

        Output the results in this format â€” no bullets, no special characters, just clean text:

        Trait: [Trait Name]
        1. [Survey statement 1]
        2. [Survey statement 2]
        3. [Survey statement 3]

        Do this for all 5 traits. Keep your language professional and clear.
